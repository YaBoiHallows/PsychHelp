# PsychHelp
THIS BOT WAS MADE FOR MY 11TH GRADE PSYCHOLOGY FINAL PROJECT.

The index file contains all information and base code. 
The config file would normally contain the bots token which is used to login into Discord, but was removed for safety purposes here.
The node_modules folder contains all code that makes the index file and such work, I did NOT code anything in the node_modules folder.
I coded index.js & config.json
